# Ransomware

The didactic project's goal is to create a ransomware that simulates the actual behavior of malware.

The project was developed for the Microsoft Windows operating system as the target of the attack, since the ransomware takes into account the root (eg C :) of the SO itself.

- C++ was used to develop the client
- Java was used to develop the server
